# Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. Early prediction of heart disease can assist healthcare professionals in taking preventive measures.

---

## 📖 Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on medical attributes.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Medical dataset containing patient health records  
- Features include:
  - Age
  - Blood pressure
  - Cholesterol levels
  - Heart rate
  - Other clinical indicators  
- Binary classification problem (disease / no disease)

---

## 🛠️ Approach
The following steps were implemented:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature selection and analysis  
- Training supervised learning models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest (if applicable)  
- Model evaluation using appropriate classification metrics  

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
Model performance was evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Sensitivity (Recall)  
- Confusion matrix  

These metrics help assess the model’s effectiveness in identifying patients with heart disease.

---

## 📊 Results
- Developed models capable of predicting heart disease risk with reliable performance  
- Feature selection improved interpretability and model efficiency
